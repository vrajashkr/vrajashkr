## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Vishwas. I'm a `complete-stack` software engineer currently working on cloud platform software at my day job.

Oh? `complete-stack`?

Glad you asked.
That means that along with being a full-stack engineer, I fortunately, or unfortunately, also like working on things above and below the usual stack :)

I enjoy tinkering with devices, operating systems, virtual machines, containers, physical networks, CI/CD, observability, and telemetry.

## What I'm currently working on
I'm currently working on a GNU tar clone in Rust in an attempt to learn the language. Inspired by [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/).

I also contribute to Zot - A scale-out production-ready vendor-neutral OCI-native container image/artifact registry.

I'm also building out my [personal website](https://vrajashkr.com/).
